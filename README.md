# Toolkit

Unofficial modding support for [Exanima](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362490/Exanima/) made in Rust.

> [!WARNING]
> Emtk is experimental software and is still in very early stages of
> development. The current state is subject to change drastically over the course
> of its lifecycle.

## Goals

- **Simple**: Make installing and making mods easy
- **Documented**: Making a mod should not be a mystery
- **Adaptable**: New game updates should be easy to migrate to
- **Cross-Platform**: Steam deck along with installation methods such as Steam
Workshop should be possible
